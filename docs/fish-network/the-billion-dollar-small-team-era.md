## **The Billion Dollar Small Team Era**

Over the past decade, we've seen an accelerating trend: billion-dollar companies being built and scaled by small, hyper-efficient teams. What used to require hundreds of employees, multiple offices, and years of infrastructure can now be accomplished by fewer than a dozen founders and operators.

AI-driven product teams and crypto protocols are positioned to capitalize on this pattern at scale: small squads, plugged into global capital and infrastructure, achieving valuations once reserved for traditional Fortune-500-scale organizations. With a rapidly evolving market economy, founders and investors are choosing tools that empower teams for this new frontier.

## **Why Current Infrastructure Falls Short In this Era**

Traditional crowdfunding portals are symptomatic of the old model:

* **High costs**: pay-to-list fees and ongoing compliance overhead.
* **Poor match quality**: high-quality issuers avoid the portals, leaving retail investors with limited choice.
* **Investor friction**: decision-making is hampered by lack of transparency and uncertain liquidity.

Crowdfunding portals are founder friendly at the expense of the investor. Investors struggle to make informed decisions, with no control over outcomes, or visibility into real-time progress. Issuers with strong fundamentals avoid portals due to fees (typically 10% of AUM for operating and legal expenses) and ongoing compliance burdens, leaving weaker deals to dominate supply.

This explains why the model hasn't scaled — strong fundamentals avoid it, and investors don't trust it.
