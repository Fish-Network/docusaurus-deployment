Neo funds represent the next evolution in investment vehicles, applying the neobank playbook to private markets. Just as neobanks embedded compliance into software-native systems after the 2008 crisis, neo funds streamline retail access to venture capital, private equity, real estate, and private credit—without altering securities laws or accreditation barriers.

## Lessons from Neobanks (2015–2025)

Before neobanks, banking relied on branch-centric distribution, manual KYC and compliance checks, poor digital interfaces, and high fixed operating costs—inefficiencies driven by legacy processes rather than regulatory mandates. Neobanks innovated by abstracting regulatory complexity behind intuitive software, automating onboarding through APIs, and delivering consumer-grade user experiences via mobile apps, dramatically reducing friction without introducing systemic risk.

Mercury exemplifies this model: by 2025, it served over 200,000 business customers, managed $20 billion in deposits, generated around $500 million in annualized revenue, and processed more than $150 billion in annual transaction volume. Mercury scaled by controlling the operating layer atop sponsor banks for regulatory coverage, prioritizing seamless digital experiences tailored to startups and digital businesses, proving that infrastructure innovation outperforms owning banking charters.

## Private Markets' Friction Trap

Private markets, encompassing trillions in assets under management across VC, PE, real estate, and private credit, remain structurally inaccessible to most investors due to high minimum investments, manual accreditation processes, opaque reporting and governance, and fragmented compliance workflows—all running on largely unchanged 1990s infrastructure. This setup sidelines vast pools of retail capital even as public markets contract and demand for high-return alternatives surges.

## What Are Neo Funds?

Neo funds modernize traditional private investment vehicles like LPs, LLCs, and trusts by making them software-native: they feature digital onboarding, embedded compliance logic, and optional tokenization purely for recordkeeping. Like neobanks layering a frictionless UI atop existing banking rails, neo funds enable low-cost, user-friendly access for average investors without rewriting securities laws—they simply streamline fund formation, administration, and participation.

Retail participation in neo funds is projected to grow from around 15 million users in 2026 to over 300 million by 2036, mirroring neobank adoption curves through reduced friction and superior infrastructure rather than speculative hype.

## Neo Funds vs. Alternatives

Traditional funds burden investors with high fees, strict accreditation requirements, extensive paperwork, and centralized control, creating significant barriers to entry. Tokenized funds demand wallet setup, incur variable gas fees, and navigate regulatory gray areas around liquidity promises, while DAOs offer low operational costs and community-driven voting but grapple with legal ambiguity and scalability limitations.

In contrast, neo funds eliminate access barriers entirely, operate at low costs with app-like simplicity, and employ a hybrid governance model that stays fully compliant with frameworks like Reg D and the Investment Company Act, sidestepping the volatility and uncertainties of pure tokenization or decentralization.

## Infrastructure: The Real Game-Changer

Just as neobanks triumphed by becoming essential financial plumbing, neo funds will dominate by standardizing investor onboarding, eligibility verification, ownership records, transfer approvals, reporting, and auditability through programmable, repeatable systems—shifting private markets from bespoke legal processes to scalable automation.

When implemented correctly, tokenization in neo funds serves as a restricted ownership registry and compliance enforcement tool, functioning as a sub-ledger that synchronizes with off-chain records; it does not create public liquidity, replace legal wrappers, or eliminate fiduciary responsibilities, ensuring regulatory acceptance.

## Fish Network Powers the Shift

Fish Network emerges as the critical infrastructure layer for neo funds, analogous to core banking platforms that enabled neobanks: it provides digital accreditation and KYC, jurisdiction-aware compliance logic, on-chain ownership representation with built-in transfer controls, and seamless synchronization with fund administrators. Importantly, Fish Network is not a fund, bank, exchange, or public marketplace—it is pure infrastructure designed to facilitate compliant, on-chain capital formation without shifting legal responsibilities or regulatory boundaries.

## Regulatory Edge

Neofunds built on such compliant infrastructure preserve key exemptions under Reg D and the Investment Company Act, maintain GP-led governance, enhance auditability and transparency, and reduce operational risks compared to manual systems—positioning them as a clear upgrade in compliance rather than an expansion of risk.

## 2026–2036: The Neo Fund Decade

As public markets shrink and private markets expand amid intensifying pressure for modernization, neo funds offer the only scalable path to broader retail participation, higher transparency, and stronger compliance, channeling trillions in idle savings into high-return opportunities like venture debt and real estate. Fish Network is not optional in this equation—it serves as the prerequisite infrastructure, echoing how neobanks unlocked explosive growth through software-native rails rather than regulatory disruption.
